For those looking for a simple answer, just use prefix + :, then type in
capture-pane -S -3000 + return
(Replace 3000 with however many lines you'd like to save.)
This copies those lines into a buffer.

Then, to save the buffer to a file, just use prefix + : again,
and type in save-buffer filename.txt + return,
replacing filename with whatever you'd like.

(By default prefix is ctrl + b.)
